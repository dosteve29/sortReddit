# sortReddit
The script uses PRAW in order to access upvotes, downvotes, saved, and hidden posts by authorized user and sort them by subreddit.
The secret.txt is used to enter credentials.
The goal of this project is to use this information to create a webpage or web application in which the sorting is presented in clear way.
Since reddit listing only gives upto 1000 posts, the app will only manage that number.
